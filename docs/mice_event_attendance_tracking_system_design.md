# MICE Event Attendance Tracking System Design

## Implementation approach

For implementing the MICE Event Attendance Tracking System, we will use the following technologies and frameworks:

1. **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS for responsive UI development
2. **Backend as a Service (BaaS)**: Supabase for database, authentication, and API management
3. **QR Code Generation**: qrcode.react library for generating QR codes
4. **QR Code Scanning**: react-qr-reader for scanning QR codes using webcam
5. **Email Sending**: nodemailer library using Gmail SMTP configuration
6. **State Management**: React Context API for simpler state management
7. **Deployment**: Vercel for hosting and deployment

### Key Components:

1. **Authentication System**: Supabase Auth with email/password login for secretaries
2. **Student Management Module**: CRUD operations for student information
3. **QR Code Generator**: Component to generate and print QR codes for students
4. **Attendance Scanner**: Interface for scanning QR codes and recording time-in/time-out
5. **Email Notification Service**: Service to send automated emails upon attendance events
6. **Dashboard & Reports**: Interface to view and analyze attendance data

### Difficult Points and Solutions:

1. **Real-time Attendance Tracking**:
   - Solution: Leverage Supabase's real-time subscriptions for instant updates

2. **Reliable QR Code Scanning**:
   - Solution: Implement fall-back manual entry options and optimize camera settings

3. **Email Notification Reliability**:
   - Solution: Implement queue system with retry mechanism for failed email sending attempts

4. **Printable QR Code Formatting**:
   - Solution: Create specialized print templates optimized for ID card attachment

## Data structures and interfaces

The system will use the following data structures and interfaces to manage the attendance tracking functionality:

### Database Schema (Supabase)

- **Students**: Student information and QR code data
- **Attendance**: Time-in and time-out records
- **Events**: Event details and tracking
- **Users**: Secretary/admin user accounts

### API Interfaces

- **Authentication API**: Login, logout, password reset
- **Student API**: Student CRUD operations
- **Attendance API**: Record and retrieve attendance data
- **QR Code API**: Generate and validate QR codes
- **Email API**: Send notifications and reports

## Program call flow

### User Authentication Flow

1. Secretary navigates to login page
2. Enters credentials
3. System validates against Supabase Auth
4. On success, redirects to dashboard
5. On failure, shows error message

### QR Code Generation Flow

1. Secretary accesses student management screen
2. Adds or selects students
3. Requests QR code generation
4. System generates unique QR codes containing student identifiers
5. QR codes are displayed in printable format

### Attendance Recording Flow

1. Secretary activates scanner mode (time-in or time-out)
2. Scans student QR code
3. System validates QR code
4. Records timestamp in Supabase database
5. Sends confirmation email to student
6. Updates attendance dashboard

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. The PRD mentions the possibility of multiple events but doesn't specify if all 30 students will participate in all events or if student groups vary by event.
2. The document doesn't define specific email template content for the notifications.
3. The exact format and dimensions for printing QR codes on student IDs aren't specified.

Despite these uncertainties, we've designed a flexible system that can accommodate various scenarios.
