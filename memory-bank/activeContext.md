   - Optimizing database queries for faster response times

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Implementing row-level security in Supabase
   - Ensuring data privacy for student information
   - Preventing unauthorized access to admin functions

5. **Future Scalability**
   - Designing the system to potentially handle more than 30 students
   - Considering multi-event scenarios
   - Planning for potential feature expansions
