## Current Status

The QR MICE Event Attendance System is currently in the **development phase**. Most of the core functionality has been implemented, including:

- Student management with QR code generation
- Event creation and management
- QR code scanning for attendance tracking
- Email notifications for attendance confirmation

The system is functional for basic use cases, with the following key features completed:

1. Admin can add, edit, and remove students
2. QR codes can be generated and printed for student IDs
3. Events can be created with date, time, and location
4. Secretary can scan QR codes to record time-in and time-out
5. Email confirmations are sent to students upon attendance

## Known Issues

1. **QR Scanner Performance**: The scanner may have difficulty in low-light conditions
2. **Email Delivery**: Occasional delays in email delivery depending on Gmail SMTP performance
3. **UI Responsiveness**: Some UI elements need refinement for optimal mobile experience
4. **Error Handling**: More comprehensive error handling and user feedback needed
5. **Browser Compatibility**: QR scanner requires testing across different browsers and devices

## Next Priorities

1. Complete the authentication system for admin access
2. Implement attendance reporting and analytics
3. Add data export functionality
4. Enhance error handling and user feedback
5. Perform thorough testing across devices
6. Prepare for production deployment to Vercel

## Timeline Projection

- **Phase 1 (Completed)**: Core functionality implementation
- **Phase 2 (Current)**: Testing and refinement
- **Phase 3 (Upcoming)**: Deployment and documentation
- **Phase 4 (Future)**: Advanced features and optimizations
